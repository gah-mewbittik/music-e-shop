# Music E-Shop

## Building a Music E-Shop

The purpose of this project is to create a full-stack e-commerce shop. This means the development of the front-end (Client-side) and the back-end (Server-side). In the application, the user is presented with a home, dashboard, and login pages. Developing this project demonstrates our full-stack development skills using Mysql2, Nodejs, Express js, Dotenv, Bcrypt, Express-handlebars, Express-sessions, connect-session-sequelize and Sequelize.

This project was developed with Sequelize version ^6.37.0 Using Sequelize assisted in forming and structuring of the database models. Along with forming the models, Sequelize was used for seeding, and the management of data. 

The following is an image of the data output from a method request made using Express js.
